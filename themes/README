A fork of mikar's collection of themes for the Awesome window manager modded for compatibility with Awesome 3.5.

The original repository can be found here:
https://github.com/mikar/awesome-themes

Feel free make pull requests with new Awesome 3.5 compatible themes.

Please note, I've only tested a few of these themes, but they seem to work just fine. Get in touch if any of them have major errors.

Credit goes to mikar for creating the original collection and joekickass for recognising the incompatibility and fixing it.
